> HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web. - Wikipedia

You're here most probably because you want to learn how to make websites and for that purpose, I would recommend learning the below three languages in the specific order to be able to make the most out of your learning:

1. [HTML](01-html.md) - to put content on your website
2. [CSS](02-css.md) - to decorate the content on your website
3. [JavaScript](03-javascript.md) - to add people interactions to your website
